## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the Django app:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hannahabebe/EvalRater2.git
   cd EvalRater2
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
    epms-venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. cd into project directory:
   ```
   cd EPMS_Project
   ```

Now that you've completed the installation and configuration steps, you're ready to run the Django app:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

By default, the app will run on `http://localhost:8000/`. You can access the app in your web browser.
